        <h3>Monitoring Forest Fires in Alberta & British Columbia</h3>
        <h4>May 2019 to June 2019</h4>
        <p>This final group project from Environmental Remote Sensing course, have trained me how remote sensing utilizes satellite/airborne based sensors to collect information about a given area, and to understand the behaviour of wildfire spread across province of Alberta and whole Canada. During the presentation, I have discussed the different electromagnetic spectrum and the interaction of electromagnetic radiation with the atmosphere that helped acquire maps and images of forests and water bodies. Also discussed how poor fire-management practice is bringing destruction to the forest ecosystem.</p>
